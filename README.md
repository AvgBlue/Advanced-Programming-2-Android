## Disclaimer

Please note that the ChitChat app has been primarily tested and developed using Android 7 (Nougat). While efforts have been made to ensure compatibility with various Android versions, there is a possibility that the app may not function properly or at all on later versions of Android.

The app's features and functionalities heavily rely on APIs, libraries, and frameworks that may have undergone changes or updates in subsequent Android versions. As a result, certain aspects of the app may exhibit unexpected behavior or may not be fully supported on newer Android versions.

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use the ChitChat app on Android 7 or later versions that are explicitly tested and supported. While the app may still function on newer Android versions, there might be limitations or issues that arise due to differences in platform behavior.

Please consider these factors and use the app accordingly. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to provide feedback or report any compatibility issues you encounter on different Android versions, as it helps us improve the app for a wider range of devices and users.

## Technologies

The ChitChat app was developed using various technologies to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. The key technologies used in the development of the app include:

- **Java**: The app's codebase is primarily written in Java, a widely used programming language known for its versatility and performance. Java provides a robust foundation for developing Android applications.

- **Room**: Room is an Android library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, enabling efficient database operations. ChitChat utilizes Room to handle data persistence and manage the app's local database.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is a comprehensive development platform provided by Google. ChitChat integrates Firebase to leverage its real-time database capabilities. This allows for instant updates and synchronization of messages and other data across devices.

- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is a popular HTTP client library for Android. It simplifies the process of making network requests and handling responses. ChitChat utilizes Retrofit to interact with the server and perform various HTTP requests for chat-related functionalities.

- **Shared Preferences**: Shared Preferences is a lightweight data storage mechanism provided by Android. ChitChat uses Shared Preferences to store and retrieve user preferences, such as theme settings and other small data that needs to be persisted across app sessions.

These technologies were carefully chosen to ensure efficient data management, seamless communication with the server, and an intuitive user experience. By leveraging the power of Java, Room, Firebase, Retrofit, and Shared Preferences, ChitChat delivers a robust and reliable messaging platform.
